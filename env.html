        <p>I finished my final Forestry Challenge as a student with my second team! We had so much fun! we may not have won (tied for 14th), but we learned a lot about building and maintaining fuel breaks. These breaks are absolutely necessary for the health of our cities and frorests, so learning about them is crucial. </p>

        <p>I came back to the Forestry Challenge again for my senior year, this time with a different team! We studied maintaining important habitat features whilst clearing out an overcrowded forest. In the end we won 5th place, but the fun we had and what we learned was far more important. </p>

        <p>My team made it to the Forestry Challenge Championships! We were unprepared, but we had fun and even placed at 9th. We discussed clearing a forest for protection from fire and disease while still protecting the habitat it creates. </p>

        <p>My first ever Forestry Challenge was such a treat. I truly found a place I felt at home working outdoors with a wonderfully kind and smart team. There was so much to be learned, but we focused on assessing how a forest was recuperating from buring down and then being cleared a few years prior. </p>

        <h2>Phenology Internship</h2>
        <p>During the Spring and Summer of 2021 I worked at the John Muirn National Historic Site as a volunteer collecting Phenology data for scientists to analyze. Phenology is the study of how the changing season affects the organisms in a certain area. My job was to work with a partner to take notes on native and non-native plants, as well as woodpeckers, to see what they did at different times of year. </p>
