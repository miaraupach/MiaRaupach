        <h2>Final Genius Hour: This Website</h2>
        <p>Woah!!! Website-ception!!! For my final Genius hour Project I made this website as cool as it is right now. I spent a lot of time and effort on it so take a look around if you haven't already. With this site as proof I can now say I know some basic HTML and CSS! </p>

        <h2>Pi Pico Project (With Xavier!)</h2>
        <p>Xavier and I learned how to code objects in the real world when we worked on this project using the raspberry pi pico. We made a stop light and a loop of rainbow colors. </p>

        <h2>AP Create Project (With Xavier!)</h2>
        <p>For our AP Create Project, my partner and I created a program that uses data entered by the user to calculate their GPA and tell them if they are or are not on track to graduate high school. The program works by comparing my high school's graduation requirements against the data they entered.</p>

        <p>As practice for the AP create project, my partner and I created a game called Fintastic Fishing! The game is a fishing clicker game that is meant to exemplify the Tragedy of the Commons in a fun way that brings awarness to the issue without being too serious.</p>

        <h2>Fall Genius Hour</h2>
        <p>For my Fall Genius Hour Project I worked on a website called CMU Academy to learn to code images in python using simple shapes. After practice with their prewritten programs, I created this image of a raven on my own! </p>

        <p>This was the first thing I ever made in Scratch, and it was very fun! My partner and I worked well together, and I’m very happy with how this first project went. You can draw all types of shapes all over the page using the program. </p>

        <p>Over the summer I learned some python. I did a lot of little projects, and I learned a lot about how computers “think”. I was also pleasantly surprised as I realized that the programs I was creating could be greatly useful to me, even as someone who isn’t planning on going into computer science professionally. For example; pictured here is a program that can quickly calculate the estimated sea level rise year by year. This program would make the jobs of Environmental Scientists just a little bit easier!</p>
