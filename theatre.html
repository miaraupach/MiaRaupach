        <h2>Spring Musical Theatre Showcase</h2>
        <p>My second Musical Theatre Showcase was such a treat! I had such a wonderful year in this class and it was such a fun culminating show. I sang in "Wait for Me (Reprise)" from Hadestown and in "Gold (Acapella)" from Once as ensemble peices. My friend Comet and I did a duet; "Partner in Crime" from Tuck Everlasting. And I sang two solos; "Dirty Dudes Must Die" from Nerdy Prudes Must Die and "My Funny Valentine" from Babes in Arms. </p>

        <h2>BITE (Benicia Improvisational Theatre Ensemble)</h2>
        <p>During the 2023-2024 school year I joined my high school's improv team. It was a fantasic way to expand my social, acting, and quick thinking skills. I truly felt so much growth personally during my time as a part of this ensemble and I had so much fun, too!</p>

        <p>Suessical was the spring musical at my high school and I was so lucky to be cast in the ensemble despite having minimal free time. I had so much fun and learned so much about the world of musical theatre through this show.</p>

          <p>Our first Musical Theatre Showcase was quite informal, but we had a lot of fun performing! I sang "What If?" from Firebringer as a solo. The whole class sang "Falling Slowly (Acapella)" from Once and "Seasons of Love" from Rent. </p>
