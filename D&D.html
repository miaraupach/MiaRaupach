        <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
        <p>I have played D&D for a long time. When I first played D&D I didn't know the rules and neither did our DM. We played on the playground everyday, we were just magical versions of ourselves, it was more roleplay than anything else. That experience opened me up to the idea of playing D&D even if I didn't really know what it was then. Later on, in late middle school and early high school I tried to start a few more campaigns, but they never turned out or lasted very long. Then I found a group to play with. I joined them during Quarantine, and I had so much fun I decided I would never stop playing TTRPGs. So I joined more groups, I played with more friends. I helped run the D&D club at my high school, and I want to do what ever I can to bring the joy I feel playing this game to others. </p>

        <h2>Dungeon Master</h2>
        <p>So far I only have a little experience DMing (playing as the role of the leader in a game of Dungeons and Dragons). I plan to practice DMing more in the future as a part of my goal to bring this game to more people. I also love story telling and this is such a wonderful medium for doing so. </p>
