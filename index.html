    <h2>Python Summer Homework</h2>
    <p><a><a href="https://github.com/CSUEB-CS100/cs100-repetition-structures-sentientmossberry/blob/main/OceanLevels.py">Ocean Levels Python Program</a></a></p>
    <p>Over the summer I learned some python. I did a lot of little projects, and I learned a lot about how computers “think”. I was also pleasantly surprised as I realized that the programs I was creating could be greatly useful to me, even as someone who isn’t planning on going into computer science professionally. For example; pictured here is a program that can quickly calculate the estimated sea level rise year by year. This program would make the jobs of Environmental Scientists just a little bit easier!</p>

      <p>This was the first thing I ever made in Scratch, and it was very fun! My partner and I worked well together, and I’m very happy with how this first project went. You can draw all types of shapes all over the page using the program. </p>

      <h2>Ceramic Mask</h2>
      <p>I created this mask for my ceramics class. We were tasked with creating a cultural mask, but I am not from just one or two cultures, so I came up with an alternate idea; using flowers! The flowers are from places in the world I have ancestry in. I used a skull as the base because I find the idea of life coming from death beautiful. It is one of the pieces I am most proud of. </p>
