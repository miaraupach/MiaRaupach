        <h2>Sanderson Sisters Holloween Costume</h2>
        <p>This last Halloween my sister, Zoe, my cousin, Juno, and I dressed up as the Sanderson Sisters. We all had our own methods of bringing the costumes together, but I personally bought some things; the cape, the corset, and the shirt, and made others; the apron and the skirt. </p>

        <h2>Bug Dress</h2>
        <p>This dress was the first thing I made using a sewing machine! It was the perfect project for summer and a great way to connect with my grandma who used to make her own clothes. It is perfectly my own outfit and I love that! </p>

        <h2>Handsewn Leaf Skirt</h2>
        <p>I took this project on after AP testing my junior year and I made it in only 8 days. It is entirely handsewn and was made in the style of a circle skirt. I found the buttons and pockets in my great-grandmother's sewing box. It was an amazingly fun project and I learned so much about sewing and just being able to try new things with confidence. </p>

        <h2>Vidar Cape</h2>
        <p>This Halloween was my first time sewing a garment for my own costume, I only made the cape, but it was a lot of work! I sewed everything by hand. It's made up of four different scrap pieces of fabric. It kind of reminds me of moss, which is fitting as my D&D character Vidar is a druid. </p>
