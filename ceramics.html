        <h2>Funk Art Rotten Tomato (November and December 2025)</h2>
        <p>The Funk Art Movement was a push for art to be goofy, disgusting, thoughtful, and irreverent. To me the thought that all good and living things must rot and be consumed to become life again is all of those things. So, I made a rotten tomato!</p>

        <p>This is a Sub-Saharan inspired African Mask. Some of the ideas I drew on were representing ideal beauty, a connection with nature and the spirit, and a lot of visual elements as well. This mask is meant to represent the fabricated difference between humanity and nature. We try to separate oursleves from our animalistic nature, but we are just as much predators and prey as they are. </p>

        <p>I made five pieces of jewelry for this project. The first is a Sir Hops-A-Lot and Crumb set of earrings, modeled off of the characters from Team Starkid's musical Cinderella's Castle. The second is a pair of almond-shaped eye earrings. The third was a gift for my mom and it is a very dapper frog, wearing a top hat, as a pin.</p>

        <p>For this project we were tasked with making a miniature scene. I was inspired to create a classic dragon on his hoard. Unseen around the corner a small advaturer can be seen, looking to claim the hoard as his own. I learned so much from the project, but most importantly I learned that sometimes, every single detail does not need to be put in. Even if it looks really good. Nevertheless, I am very happy with how this came out. </p>

        <p>For this project we had to create a relief, which means we had to make a mostly flat image look 3D. It was super fun and rewarding to experiment with flat textures to create this scene. I chose to make oaken foothills because I have a lot of friends and family that live in this environment fostering a deep connection to that habitat. </p>

        <h3>"Coyote!" - Banana Slug String Band</h3>
        <p>For this project we were tasked with creating a ceramic animal. This was a very interesting experience because we had to make it hollow so it could dry, btut also have holes for air to escape while it cooked so it wouldn't explode. It was my first experience with making something look solid that is not solid. I made a coyote because I wanted to make an animal from my home that I had a personal connection with. </p>

        <p>I created this mask for my ceramics class. We were tasked with creating a cultural mask, but I am not from just one or two cultures, so I came up with an alternate idea; using flowers! The flowers are from places in the world I have ancestry in. I used a skull as the base because I find the idea of life coming from death beautiful. It is one of the pieces I am most proud of. </p>
