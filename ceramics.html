        <h2>Vegvisir Tile</h2>
        <p>Vegvisir, otherwise known as the Viking compass, represents finding one's path in life. This is one of my favorite symbols because it reminds me that no matter what decisions I make I am headed down my best path in life. The symbols surrounding it are things that make life beautiful and worth exploring to me. </p>

        <p>The labyrinth represents wholeness and the never-ending journey that is life. The way I designed the tile is meant to appear like moss growing over a carving of the symbol in a rock. This tile is installed in a planter box at my high school. </p>

        <p>I made five pieces of jewelry for this project. The first is a Sir Hops-A-Lot and Crumb set of earrings, modeled off of the characters from Team Starkid's musical Cinderella's Castle. The second is a pair of almond-shaped eye earrings. The third was a gift for my mom and it is a very dapper frog, wearing a top hat, as a pin.</p>

        <h2>Foarging Bowl</h2>
        <p>I am very interesting in foraging and eating food from the environment around me. So wehn we had to make food for a roject I knew exactly what I wanted to make. Every single food in this bowl can be found in California!  </p>

        <h2>Muddy Boot</h2>
        <p>For the footwear project I wanted to tell a story. An worn and muddy boot is much more interesting than a pristine shoe to me. So that's what I made. It's simple, but it's fun. </p>

        <h2>Dragon Miniature Scene</h2>
        <p>For this project we were tasked with making a miniature scene. I was inspired to create a classic dragon on his hoard. Unseen around the corner a small advaturer can be seen, looking to claim the hoard as his own. I learned so much from the project, but most importantly I learned that sometimes, every single detail does not need to be put in. Even if it looks really good. Nevertheless, I am very happy with how this came out. </p>

        <p>I made this sailboat for the vehicle project in my ceramics class. It's named after the boat from one of my D&D groups the "Gecko" and it is called "The HMS Tokay". It's current passengers are the kodamas from "Princess Mononoke." </p>

        <h2>Oak Relief</h2>
        <p>For this project we had to create a relief, which means we had to make a mostly flat image look 3D. It was super fun and rewarding to experiment with flat textures to create this scene. I chose to make oaken foothills because I have a lot of friends and family that live in this environment fostering a deep connection to that habitat. </p>

        <h2>Coyote Statue</h2>
        <h3>"Coyote!" - Banana Slug String Band</h3>
        <p>For this project we were tasked with creating a ceramic animal. This was a very interesting experience because we had to make it hollow so it could dry, btut also have holes for air to escape while it cooked so it wouldn't explode. It was my first experience with making something look solid that is not solid. I made a coyote because I wanted to make an animal from my home that I had a personal connection with. </p>

        <h2>Ceramic Mask</h2>
        <p>I created this mask for my ceramics class. We were tasked with creating a cultural mask, but I am not from just one or two cultures, so I came up with an alternate idea; using flowers! The flowers are from places in the world I have ancestry in. I used a skull as the base because I find the idea of life coming from death beautiful. It is one of the pieces I am most proud of. </p>

        <h2>Pinch Pot Mug</h2>
        <p>This was the first project in my high school ceramics class. We made pinch pots and I decided to make a mug. I thought it would be fun to put and ocean with a little sailboat atop it. It sails below a nigh sky in which the second star to the right can be seen. </p>
